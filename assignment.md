   - Weather description (e.g., sunny, cloudy, etc.)
   - Humidity
   - Wind speed
   - Any other relevant weather information you think is important
5. Display appropriate weather icons or images based on the weather condition.
6. Handle errors gracefully and provide meaningful error messages if the API request fails or if the location is not found.
7. Add any additional features or enhancements that you think would improve the application.
